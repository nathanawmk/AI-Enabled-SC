# Abstract.
This paper explores in detail the possible applications and wide-ranging usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Smart Contracts (SC) in different industries. It also explores self-learning capabilities within smart contracts that learns from its inputs while at the same time adhering to contractual clauses. Reference Implementation based on Tensor Flow and Solidity is ongoing and is expected to be released in Q4 2018.
