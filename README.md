# Abstract.
At first glance, AI-Enabled Smart Contracts seems to be an oxymoron -- A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form which necessitates that its behaviour/outcome is bounded based on input conditions. AI, however, connotes intelligent being like behaviour which is unbounded.  

This paper seeks to bridge the gap.  

This paper explores in detail the possible applications and wide-ranging usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Smart Contracts (SC) in different industries. It also explores self-learning capabilities within smart contracts that learns from its inputs while at the same time adhering to contractual clauses. Reference Implementation based on Tensor Flow and Solidity is ongoing and is expected to be released in Q4 2018.
