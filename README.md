# Abstract.
At first glance, AI-Enabled Smart Contracts seems to be an oxymoron -- A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form which necessitates that its behaviour/outcome is bounded based on input conditions. (A parallel to draw will be a java method that takes in two input and does a multiplication and/or a deterministic consensus algorithm.) AI, however, connotes human like behaviour/outcome which is unbounded. 

This paper seeks to bridge the gap.  

This paper also explores in detail the possible applications and wide-ranging usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Smart Contracts (SC) in different industries. It also explores self-learning capabilities within smart contracts that learns from its inputs while at the same time adhering to contractual clauses. Reference Implementation based on AI Framework (E.g., Tensor Flow) and Solidity is ongoing and is expected to be released in Q4 2018. 

Note: This paper is not a rehash or extension of "Plasma: Scalable Autonomous Smart Contracts" (https://plasma.io/). For example, this paper does not address scalability concerns.
